[ For troubleshooting and game issues ]


**How to install?

 - Simply copy the contents of the zip file to a directory. 
   You only need to worry about MTSP_FiM.exe and the /rsrc/ folder being in the same place.
   The /rsrc folder containing all the images it needs will help.


**Warning!

 - MTSP tries to create some files and folders it needs, like mtsp.ini and ignores.txt.
   If you don't have file or directory creation privileges, MTSP will surely not work properly.


**MTSP won't run!

 - Try downloading the visual c++ 2010 redistributable package.
   It's annoying that you have to download this stuff, but it's a pretty small download,
   and will allow you to run all sorts of programs with less errors.

   (I've heard that the 64 bit version DOESN'T work)

 - You might need to update your .net framework. Get 4.0 here:

 - Try right click -> properties -> compatibility mode -> XP Service Pack 3 on MTSP.exe


** Why am I having trouble running a certain game?

 - For Pokemon Type Wild, try renaming uUTYPE WILD.exe and uUTYPE WILD.kgt
   to wild.exe and wild.kgt.

 - For Vanguard Princess, remove all Japanese writing from the directories.
   Then, try renaming the .exe and .kgt to vp.exe and vp.kgt.
   You may need to switch to Japanese locale.


**Why doesn't spectate work?

 - Because you or the host are using a version of MTSP older than 1.94.

**MTSP crashes when starting a match!

 - One of you may have illegal characters in your name.
   Illegal characters can't be used in file paths, and the replay file
   can't be created. This causes a crash. (fixed, but still occurs on the original MTSP)

 - Some settings in your ini may be messed up. Try deleting the .ini
   and redoing all your MTSP settings.


**Weird lag and FPS drops when playing

 - Are you using the joystick option inside the game? Do not use that.
   Use joy2key or xpadder or something. Native FighterMaker joystick support is slow and bad.

 - Try activating the "FPS stutter fix" in the performance tab of the program settings. 
   (Or deactivate it if it doesn't help you)

 - Try activating the faster input polling + netcode hack.

 - The game blits to the screen slightly faster if the window is properly set as 640x480.
   Fullscreen mode is slow, but faster on certain systems than a window.

 - Replay saving incurs a minor performance hit.

 - Get a better internet.


**I get stuck after someone/I fail to challenge someone, and can't do anything until reconnecting.

 - Click the rest button twice and it should reset your state.


**Why do my pings/challenges/packets sometimes work but sometimes fail for no reason?

 - Various networking issues. Maybe one side's ports aren't properly set. Maybe someone's
   router/hardware is idling. Maybe firewalls are blocking UDP traffic.
   Maybe they have minimized the program for more than 5 minutes. Sometimes reconnecting helps.


**Why is their IP address red?

 - It means they aren't connected from the usual address. Either it's not the same person,
   or they have a dynamic IP, or they are connecting from a different internet source.


**My problem still isn't solved

 - If all else fails, try using the original MTSP, which is still compatible with this program,
   although there is virtually no chance that this will solve the problem.
