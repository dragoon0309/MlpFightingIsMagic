=> If you want to add/remove skills or players or anything in a list with FM2K, ADD IT AT THE END/REMOVE ONLY THE LAST, everything is referenced by its position in the lists so if you add/remove an item in the middle it'll offset and break everything ! Always add/remove at the end.
=> Don't apply patch for same color in VS, it'll break the grey palette swap of story mode !
=> OP you should really withhold update posts until peak times such as Thursdays and Fridays. That way you can reach a wider audience and have a better chance to pick up help
